# Resource Pack Encryption

The resource pack encryption means that PowerNukkitX enables you to use resource packs encrypted by you. You only need to configure a 32-key for your resource pack according to the following tutorial to enable the player client to load normally.

***Just 3 steps, keep up and get started!***

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
    Please note that resource pack encryption cannot completely prevent people with ulterior motives from stealing your resource pack since it is using `AES`, a symmetric key encryption.
</Callout>


## 1. Encrypt my resource pack
Choose a tool to encrypt your resource pack.
We recommend using [EncryptMyPack](https://github.com/AllayMC/EncryptMyPack)

Some precautions:
- The resource pack must end with `.mcpack`. If you are using a ZIP file right now, simply rename it to `.mcpack`.
- The root directory of the file cannot be nested with folders. The `manifest.json` file must be visible in the root directory of the resource pack.

<Callout type="info">
    PowerNukkitX itself does not contain any encryption and decryption logic, it only sends the encryption keys to the client according to your configuration
</Callout>


## 2. Configure your key
Create a new file named after your resource pack, ending with `.key`.
After creating the file, paste the encryption key inside it.

Example file structure of your `resource_packs` folder:

| File          | Description                                  |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------|
| x1.mcpack     | A resource pack named `x1`                   |
| x1.mcpack.key | This is the key of `x1.mcpack` resource pack |

## 3. Restart the server for your changes to take effect

PowerNukkitX will only load the files located inside `resource_packs` on startup.
