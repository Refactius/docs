# Generic usage
As some features are common to each form type, here is a quick summary of them all.

## Title
Every form type has a title element. You can add the title either inside the constructor or using the method.
```java
// Using the constructor
CustomForm custom = new CustomForm("title");
ModalForm modal = new ModalForm("title");
SimpleForm simple = new SimpleForm("title");

// Using the method
custom.title("other title");
modal.title("other title");
simple.title("other title");
```

## Listeners
Each form can execute a consumer that handles the response when a form is submitted or closed.
```java
form.onSubmit((player, response) -> {
    /*
    
    Handle the form response here,
    the object depends on the form you've created.
    For details, check out the specific form documentation.

    */
})
form.onClose(player -> player.sendMessage("You have closed the form!"));
```

## Sending forms

```java
form.send(player);
```

Optionally, you can pass on an ID for the form *(not recommended)*
```java
form.send(player, 123);
```

## Metadata
Forms support passing on metadata which can be used, for example, to identify forms opened by a player, which in return can help to e.g. update them.

### Adding metadata
You can add anything as metadata - literally.
```java
// Example: Saving an entity
Entity entity = ...;

form.putMeta("form-type", "manage-entity")
    .putMeta("entity", entity);
```

### Reading metadata
To read the metadata again, you can use the `Form#getMeta(String)` method.
```java
Entity entity = form.getMeta("entity");
```

If you are unsure the form acutally contains the element, you can add a default value:
```java
Entity entity = form.getMeta("entity", backupEntity);
```

## Retrieving viewers
If you are reusing a form and it can be sent to multiple people at once (e.g. a team selector), you can retrieve all the viewers of a form.
```java
ObjectArraySet<Player> viewers = form.viewers();
```

Alternatively, you can manually check if a player has opened the form:
```java
boolean isViewer = form.isViewer(player);
```
