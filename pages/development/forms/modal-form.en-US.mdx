# ModalForm
The **ModalForm** is a modal form inside Minecraft featuring two clickable buttons commonly used for decision-making. Follow the steps below to find out how to use this form inside PNX.
It consists of:
- A title
- Content: A small description of the form
- Two buttons: Yes or no

## Title & Content
There are various ways to set the title and content of a form.

### Using the constructor
```java
// Setting the title and content within the constructor
ModalForm form = new ModalForm("title", "content");
```
```java
// Only setting the title within the constructor
ModalForm form = new ModalForm("title");
```

### Using methods
```java
// Setting the title and content using methods
ModalForm form = new ModalForm()
                    .title("title")
                    .content("content");
```

## Changing the buttons
You can easily change the button text and add a listener using two methods:
```java
form.yes("Yes!", player -> player.sendMessage("You said yes!"))
    .no("No!", player -> player.sendMessage("You said no!"))
```

If you just want to adjust the text, you can make use of multiple methods.
```java
// Both buttons
form.text("Yes!", "No!");

// Only the 'yes'-button
form.yesText("Yes!!");

// Only the 'no'-button
form.noText("No!!");
```

## Listeners

### Added directly
You can directly add a listener to the buttons. If clicked by the player, the code will execute.
```java
form.onYes(player -> player.sendMessage("You said yes!!"))
    .onNo(player -> player.sendMessage("You said no!!"))
```

### Whole form
You can listen to the whole form to detect if it has been submitted or closed.
```java
form.onSubmit((player, response) -> {
    int buttonId = response.buttonId(); // The ordinal of the clicked button (-1 if invalid)
    // buttonId returns 0 if 'yes' was clicked, 1 if 'no' was clicked
    boolean yes = response.yes(); // Returns true if 'yes' was clicked
});

form.onClose(player -> player.sendMessage("You have closed the form!"));
```

### Using the event
You can listen to the `PlayerFormRespondedEvent`.
```java
@EventHandler
public void on(PlayerFormRespondedEvent event) {
    Player player = event.getPlayer(); // The player who submitted the form
    Form<?> form = event.getWindow(); // The window which has been responded to
    Response response = event.getResponse(); // The response; null if closed

    // Example: Check if a ModalForm called 'Ingots' was accepted
    if (form.title().equals("Ingots") && response instanceof ModalResponse modalResponse) { // Using instanceof, we also make sure it wasn't closed
        boolean yes = modalResponse.yes();

        player.sendMessage(yes ? "You accepted the ingot." : "You rejected the ingot.");
    }
}
```

## Example final code
To sum up the site, here is a quick example of how your form could look like in the end:
```java
ModalForm form = new ModalForm("Ingots", "Do you want to buy 1x Netherite Ingot for $1000?")
            .yes("Yes, I want to!", pl -> pl.sendMessage("You accepted the offer!"))
            .no("No, I don't want to!", pl -> pl.sendMessage("You rejected the offer."))
            .onSubmit((pl, response) -> {
                boolean yes = response.yes();
                pl.sendMessage("You have clicked " + (yes ? "yes" : "no"));
            })
            .onClose(pl -> pl.sendMessage("Oh no, you've closed the form!"))
            .send(player);
```
