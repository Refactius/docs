# Spark
Spark is an advanced performance profiler for Minecraft clients, servers and proxies.
Sometimes it is necessary to monitor performance in case the server causes lag. Spark helps determining the cause so you can quickly roll out a patch.

## Set up Spark within PNX

<Steps>
    ### Open the configuration file <a href="/configuration/files/pnx-yml">pnx.yml</a>.

    ### Locate the `settings` tab.
    
    ### Set `installSpark` to `true`.

    ```yaml filename="pnx.yml"
    settings:
        installSpark: true
    ```
</Steps>
