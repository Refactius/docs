# WaterdogPE Proxy
Using a proxy, you can seamlessly transfer players between multiple servers. This is especially important if you are setting up a larger network which requires more flexibility.

PowerNukkitX natively supports the [WaterdogPE](https://github.com/WaterdogPE/WaterdogPE) proxy.
To enable the support, follow the steps below.

## Usage

<Steps>
    ### Open the configuration file <a href="/configuration/files/pnx-yml">pnx.yml</a>.
    ### Locate the `settings` tab.
    ### Set `waterdogpe` to `true`.

    ```yaml filename="pnx.yml"
    settings:
        waterdogpe: true
    ```
</Steps>

You only need to adjust the <a href="/configuration/files/pnx-yml">pnx.yml</a> in each sub-server by setting `waterdogpe=true` to use WaterdogPE.

<Callout type="info">
    Before you transfer a player, you should close all inventories for the player.
    Otherwise, the player might not be able to open their inventory on another server.
